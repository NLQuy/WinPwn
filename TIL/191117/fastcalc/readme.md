## Description

What would a CONFidence CTF be without a Windows-hosted exploitation challenge? :) This time you're facing a fast, greatly optimized calculator capable of concurrently evaluating multiple expressions. In fact it is so technically advanced that it will only run on CPUs supporting the cutting-edge SSE2 extension. Do you think you can hack it?
